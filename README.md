## _**Sandvik Web Application**_

## Introduction
This repository was created by the Period 7 Group 6 Team, JJALK, for CEN 3031, Introduction to Software Engineering. The repository utilizes the MERN stack, a structure which utilizes MongoDB, Express.Js, React.js, and Node.js to create a funtional web application. The final deployable version of this repository is hosted on Heroku. This project was a collaboration between the University of Florida course and the company, Sandvik. The objective of this project was to create a web application that would allow sales personnel to input values into a calculator that would output optimal drills that were usable for customer that the personnel was talking to. Furthermore, there was to be offline capabilities so the sales personnel would be able to calculate the drills on-site, which would possibly not have internet or data connections.
